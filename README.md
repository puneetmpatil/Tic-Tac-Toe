### About Game
It is a two player human vs human game (X & O). The objective is to get 3 X's/O's in a row/column/diagonal.
When any square is clicked it will be marked X/O depending upon whose turn it is.
The result will be displayed either after a person wins the game or all the 9 squares are occupied without the objective being filled.
